kWh Pulse Meter Sensor
======

This Arduino sketch is built to support reading an analog ferrarismeter in both ways (this is useful if you have solar panels ;-) )

Sensors:
- TCRT5000 IR Tracking Sensor

When the analog power meter is turning and the masked part goes by the sensors, we sense the IR light and count power either positive or negative. This sketch needs 2 sensors to support sensing the direction of the power.
